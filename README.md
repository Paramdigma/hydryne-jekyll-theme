Hydra was made by [Alan Rynne](http://rynne.es/) for [Paramdigma](https://paramdigma.com), an independent collective of Computational Designers, Architects and Engineers aiming to push technological adoption within the AEC industry.


## Features

> Most features from Hydra have been maintained, although backwards compatibility is broken due to the changes required by GitHub's `remote-theme` feature.

## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics and Disqus keys to `_config.yml`.

## Develop

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
